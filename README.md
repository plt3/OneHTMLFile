# OneHTMLFile

> Collection of single-HTML file web apps

## Motivation:

I've often found myself with a problem that could be solved by a small iOS app I could write, but I don't want to pay $100/year for an Apple developer account just to have my app on my iPhone. Thanks to [this Stack Overflow answer](https://stackoverflow.com/a/73903200/14146321), I found out that the Microsoft Edge iOS app supports opening local HTML files and running JavaScript from them. However, everything must be contained in a single HTML file, meaning that you cannot link to other files for CSS, JavaScript, or images. So, I began writing these webapps and wrote a script to compile separate HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and image files into one HTML file that I can then run on my phone.
